Project: Student Record Management System

Project Description: 

This project is a Record Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to manage student and course records, as well as grades and attendance information. The system is built using classes and provides a menu-based interface for users to interact with the system. 

Features:
- Add, Edit, and Delete students: Users can add new students to the system, edit their details, or delete existing students.
- Add, Edit, and Delete courses: Users can add new courses, edit their details, or delete existing courses.
- Add, Edit, and Delete grades: Users can add grades for students in specific courses, edit the grades if needed, or delete grades.
- Add, Edit, and Delete attendance: Users can add attendance records for students in specific courses, edit attendance records, or delete existing records.
- Display student and course details: Users can display details of a specific student or course, including their name, ID, email, course code, and description.
- Display all students and courses: Users can view a list of all students and courses currently stored in the system.
- Data validation and error handling: The system includes checks to prevent duplicate student or course entries and provides appropriate error messages when needed.

Future Enhancements:
- Data storage capabilities: The system can be modified to include functionality for saving and loading records from a file or a database.
- User authentication: Implementing a user authentication system to secure access to the records and prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Additional functionalities: Enhance the system to include features such as generating reports, calculating GPA, and sending automated notifications to students or faculty members.

This project serves as a foundation for managing student and course records in an educational institution. It can be extended and customized to meet the specific needs of different educational institutions or organizations.
